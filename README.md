Ridesharing data using Python

Ride Sharing Analysis

Overview of Ride Sharing

In this challenge, we are reviewing data from a Python based ridesharing app, PyBer. There are two datasets to analyze, which includes information on location, date and fare for every ride, the type of city and number of drivers. The three types of cities; urban, suburban, and rural will be examined for inconsistencies. PyBer will use these findings to help make their app more affordable in underserved neighborhoods and provide better access to ridesharing. 
 
Results

Upon reviewing the results of the data collected, there are disparities in the data when graphed by type of city. Fares are significantly higher in the rural cities than in suburban or urban cities. The average fare cost in a rural city is more than $10 what the average fare cost is in an urban city. There are also substantially more drivers in urban and suburban cities than in the rural ones. Urban cities have 2,405 drivers, which is almost 31x the number of drivers in rural cities. The below visuals demonstrate the entirety of our data findings, including total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.
