Ridesharing data using Python

Ride Sharing Analysis

Overview of Ride Sharing

In this challenge, we are reviewing data from a Python based ridesharing app, PyBer. There are two datasets to analyze, which includes information on location, date and fare for every ride, the type of city and number of drivers. The three types of cities; urban, suburban, and rural will be examined for inconsistencies. PyBer will use these findings to help make their app more affordable in underserved neighborhoods and provide better access to ridesharing. 
 
Results

Upon reviewing the results of the data collected, there are disparities in the data when graphed by type of city. Fares are significantly higher in the rural cities than in suburban or urban cities. The average fare cost in a rural city is more than $10 what the average fare cost is in an urban city. There are also substantially more drivers in urban and suburban cities than in the rural ones. Urban cities have 2,405 drivers, which is almost 31x the number of drivers in rural cities. The below visuals demonstrate the entirety of our data findings, including total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

Summary

Based on the results, there are several recommendations that can be made to improve PyBerâ€™s business model and allow for more affordability to its riders.

-One recommendation would be to gather specific demographics on the types of riders who use the app. Having more insight on what type of demographics to target, such as age and income level, could prove useful for the marketing this app. This could then be used to show different types of targeted advertisements based on demographics that are more common in a specific type of city.

-Another recommendation would be to advertise less in suburban neighborhoods. There is the least amount of discrepancy in this type of city based on number of drivers, average fare cost and total rides. Because this type of city is the most self-sustaining and reliable, it does not need as much marketing. Focusing less on suburban areas and more on the urban and rural cities would help create more business in the areas where it is lacking.

-Lastly, a recommendation would be to decrease the fares for riders in rural cities. Making the ridesharing services more affordable would encourage more consumers to utilize PyBer for transportation and would help to drive business up.
